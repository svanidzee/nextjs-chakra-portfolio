About.
Howdy, I'm Derek, a web designer, and developer located in Austin, TX. I have over 16 years of experience with front-end development, web design.

My core development technologies are WordPress, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. My core design technologies are paper, pen, Figma, Webflow, and the ever-powerful browser-based design.

I believe that good things take time and great things take sacrifice. I also believe that we should try our best to laugh as much as possible.
