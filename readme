Hello, I am Federico, a digital product designer focused on user experience, user interface and interaction. I have been creating mainly UX/UI design over the past 3 years, but my work spans across digital design to branding, as well as creative & art directions, graphics, interior design, photography and frontend development. I build experiences from screens, mobiles to physical spaces. No matter the mediums, through my work I aim to blur the line between design, art and technology while always pushing the boundaries of my creativity.

What about me. My name is Federico Kratter Thaler. Yes, my surname is Austrian, no, (unfortunately) I can’t speak german. I’m 24 and I am from Milan, Italy. While in high school I developed a special passion for photography, which subsequently led me to approach the world of art and design and then to start my studies (in Interior design) at Politecnico di Milano.

During those three years, in addition to investigating the themes of space and living, I also had the opportunity to explore the world of user experience, interaction and communication design thanks to my first projects as a freelancer. Those experiences made me realize that those were the areas I wanted to focus on.

My first work experience was in Value Partners, a consulting firm based in Milan, trough which I took part to various projects as User Interface Designer, as well as User Experience & Interaction Designer, collaborating with clients such as Juventus, UnipolSai, Zegna, Crif, Edison and OneofUs.
I currently work as Product Designer at Octostar, an Irish startup that is developing the next generation of investigative intelligence software.
